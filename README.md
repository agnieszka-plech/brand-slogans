# Brand-slogans

<h1>Brand Slogans - Analysis of Slogans, Logos and Gender of CEOs in Brands and Companies<span class="tocSkip"></span></h1>



<h2>About the project<span class="tocSkip"></span></h2>

This is my final project for the AllWomen Data Science and Data Analytics Bootcamp, which was presented in April 2021.


<h3>Why this project?<span class="tocSkip"></span></h3>

Every day we are exposed to ads and brand campaigns, therefore it's natural that some of those catchy phrases stuck to our minds. 

I wanted to investigate what hides behind the brand slogans, if there are any patterns they have in common and if gender of the CEO has any impact on them. I also analyse the colors of the logos of the brands and companies. 


<h3>Data Sources<span class="tocSkip"></span></h3>

- The original slogan dataset comes from Kaggle and can be downloaded here:

        https://www.kaggle.com/rihim421/brands-slogan-and-trademark-analysis

        I manually added the missing slogans and a category each brand belongs to.

- The list of the CEOs was scraped from Wikipedia. I extracted the gender by using the genderize API and filled in the missing values by manual search.
        https://genderize.io

- I also analysed the logos of the brands and those were downloaded manually.


Here are some of the resources and inspirations I used for the project:
